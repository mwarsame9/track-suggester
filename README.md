# Track Suggester

#### This is my second individual project. I create a webpage to help prospective Epicodus students pick the right track.


#### By Mohamed Warsame

## Description

On this website I help students who are unsure about what track to choose make a decision. I do this by asking them five questions that are relevant in determining the best track. I use a combination of text box and dropdown fields for the form. There is also a hyperlink to the tracks offered by Epicodus.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* I started with empty page
* Then I created my code using HTML, CSS, Bootsrtap, JavaScript and jQuery
* Instead of completely downloading jQuery and Bootsrtap, I went to their websites and linked
* I also used a special font that I got from Google which I linked
* I committed throughout
